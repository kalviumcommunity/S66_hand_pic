I chose this project because it‚Äôs a simple and fun way to share and rate hand pictures. Hands are something we use every day, but we don‚Äôt always pay attention to how interesting they can be.

- Making the site user-friendly and accessible.  

It‚Äôs a great way to practice these skills while making something fun for people.

## üîß Deployment Configuration

### CORS Setup
The backend is configured to allow requests from:
- `http://localhost:5173` (Local Vite dev)
- `http://localhost:5174` (Local Vite dev)
- `https://handscape-o.netlify.app` (Production frontend)
- `https://s66-hand-pic.onrender.com` (Production backend)

### Cookie Configuration
- **Development**: `secure: false, sameSite: 'Lax'`
- **Production**: `secure: true, sameSite: 'None', domain: '.onrender.com'`

### Environment Variables Required
```env
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8888
mongoURI=mongodb+srv://...
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting CORS Issues

If you see CORS errors like:
```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8888/...' from origin 'https://handscape-o.netlify.app' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Deploy your backend** - The frontend is trying to connect to localhost instead of production
2. **Update environment** - Set `NODE_ENV=production` on Render
3. **Check URLs** - Ensure all API calls use `https://s66-hand-pic.onrender.com`
4. **Verify CORS config** - Backend allows your Netlify domain

## üöÄ Quick Fix Commands

**Restart backend with production settings:**
```bash
cd Server
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

**Check backend status:**
```bash
curl https://s66-hand-pic.onrender.com/ping
```

**Verify CORS configuration:**
```bash
curl -H "Origin: https://handscape-o.netlify.app" https://s66-hand-pic.onrender.com/
```
