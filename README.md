## Why This Project?  
I chose this project because it’s a simple and fun way to share and rate hand pictures. Hands are something we use every day, but we don’t always pay attention to how interesting they can be.  

This project will help me learn important web development skills like:  
- Uploading pictures.  
- Building a voting system.  
- Making the site user-friendly and accessible.  

It’s a great way to practice these skills while making something fun for people.
